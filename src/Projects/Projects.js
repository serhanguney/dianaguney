    central of Stockholm city. Gamla Stan has been the spot for skinheads since 1980. A place where
    skinheads would come to listen to music, make graffiti and simply spend time together. Although
    Skinheads is a culture that has been neglected and denied for years, with my design of my graffiti
    walls I am to increase their visibility and get their voices heard, from pedestrians to the sea, the
    graffiti walls will be visible on all urban levels. The concrete walls which will create unsafe
    semi-private rooms will be used for Graffiti painting. By activating the place in this way I
    strongly believe I will catch a broader audience to the place (Skinheads, Hipsters, Gothics and
    indie kids etc). By dedicating such a central place in Stockholm to subcultures I believe it can
    give the smaller groups a chance to integrate with the rest of the society and get their voices
    heard.`,
