    text: "A house made of cardboard tubes.",
    paragraph: `The location of this house is in a villa district in southern Stockholm. The aim was to increase housing in Stockholm by building on land owned by someone else, this way housing would increase with maximum use of property. The land owner could either sell or rent his property. I tried to create a generous house for one or two students, with courtesy, non extravagant touch on this shared land. Just like a butterfly, the house was supposed to be gentle without any harsh intervention on the ground, It was going to be spacious and affordable. These were my primary criterias. My references were taken from Shigeru Ban and his use of Cardboard tubes on different edifices around the world. Hence my construction is formed by the help of paper tube constructions by Shigeru Ban. This project has taught me loads and allowed me to experiment and invent new construction elements that can serve to cardboard tube architecture.`,

    paragraph: `Boring architecture is a research and experimentation that explores the role of architecture in regards to
    how we feel and react to certain rooms and urban spaces. What triggers boring architecture, can architecture affect our mood
    and emotions? This is a research project that aims to understand the links between architecture and human psychology.
    Starting off with getting to know myself and what I find boring and what boring means to me.
    Resulting with a model of my childhood bedroom has led me into understanding typologies around my neighborhood and
    why some of them speak boring to me. I found myself in the middle of this more aware of my own architecture and
    a widening knowledge of my surroundings. In the end I appreciate and understand ​Invisible Cities b​y Italo Calvino
    and in the end I found the cities and neighborhoods that I would like to live in in some reality different than this.`,

    text: `Capturing a culture.`,
    paragraph: `This is a project aimed to lift and ​strengthen​ the character of this urban area, located at the central of Stockholm city. Gamla Stan has been the spot for skinheads since 1980.
    A place where skinheads would come to listen to music, make graffiti and simply spend time together.
    Although Skinheads is a culture that has been neglected and denied for years, with my design of my graffiti walls I am to increase their visibility and get their voices heard, from pedestrians to the sea, the graffiti walls will be visible on all urban levels.
    The concrete walls which will create unsafe semi-private rooms will be used for Graffiti painting.
    By activating the place in this way I strongly believe I will catch a broader audience to the place (Skinheads, Hipsters, Gothics and indie kids etc).
    By dedicating such a central place in Stockholm to subcultures I believe it can give the smaller groups a chance to integrate with the rest of the society and get their voices heard.`,

In this day and age there are immense ways of expressing oneself and creating art. I am trying to find my own way to tell stories. Feelings, thoughts, people, buildings, words, the sun and the skies. To create something that tells a story must be the most satisfying thing so here I am experimenting with hand drawings, paintings and sketches and computer aided design. To experiment and explore ways to tell thoughts, express feelings, understand the surrounding and ultimately tell a story.`,

It is not necessarily aimed to fix anything but rather understand the existing beauty and brutality of a concrete structure and work with extending and creating new opportunities to its plan and facade. This project is proposing ways to add balconies to an existing concrete structure that is undergoing an interior change from office space to a hotel.

This is a creative journey that resulted in outdoor seating for the whole summer of 2020. This is a furniture project done for a restaurant in Stockholm. The owner wanted designer furniture for his outdoor seating that would highlight the essence of his restaurant and brand. The furniture was designed, made and constructed by me and my colleague.`,

    structure primarily made because of the need for a public bathroom, Living on the edge aims to not only provide public restrooms but to also give that little extra to its visitors. By placing niches just on the edge of the mountain, sitting will now feel like floating, and the view will be experienced through a birds-eye view. How would you like to live like a bird for a while, floating on the edge of this mountain.`,
