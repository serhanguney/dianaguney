    title: "Episodes Of Feelings",
    text: "Narrative driven Design, Master of Architecture",
    paragraph: `How can Architecture act as a medium of storytelling ? Architecture has been used as a physical
    medium that goes beyond providing shelter, but also to tell stories or document historical epochs.
    The architectural structures of old were designed to give its visitors an experience steeped in
    narrative such as biblical scriptures or even engender feelings of awe as they passed through a
    space. This is evident in the well established culture of architecture being something you
    experience, not merely a thing viewed through images. A building can not speak to you without
    you being beside or inside it. Architecture is an experience, an adventure and it is storytelling.
    Understanding nor organising are not enough nor necessary (John Hejduk). This project was an
    opportunity for me to go after my dreams and passion of exploring storytelling through
    architecture. My love for film and cinema, fairy tales, magic and myths. To somehow connect
    architecture to my passion of storytelling, whilst being challenging, has taken me to places
    unknown and helped me rediscover architecture, space and the human itself`,

    paragraph: `The location of this house is in a villa district in southern Stockholm. The project aimed to
    increase housing in Stockholm by building on land owned by someone else. The landowner
    could either sell or rent his property. I tried to create a generous and flexible house for one or two
    occupants, with the courtesy, non-extravagant touch on this shared land. Just like a butterfly, the
    house was supposed to be gentle without any harsh intervention on the ground. It was going to be
    spacious and affordable. My references were taken from Shigeru Ban and his use of Cardboard
    tubes for structures used as shelters. This project has taught me loads and allowed me to
    experiment and invent new construction elements that could potentially facilitate affordable
    architecture for the future.`,

    regards to how we feel and react to certain rooms and urban spaces. What triggers boring
    architecture, can architecture affect our mood and emotions? This is a research project that aims
    to understand the links between architecture and human psychology. Starting off with getting to
    know me and what I find boring and what boring means to me. Resulting with a model of my
    childhood bedroom has led me to understand typologies around my neighborhood and why some
    of them speak boring to me. I found myself in the middle of this more aware of my own
    architecture and widening knowledge of my surroundings. In the end, I appreciate and
    understand Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, and in the end, I found the cities and neighborhoods
    that I would like to live in some reality different from this.`,

    Gamla Stan has been the spot for skinheads since 1980. A place where skinheads would come to
    listen to music, make graffiti, and spend time together. Although Skinheads is a culture that has
    been outcast for years, with the graffiti walls I aim to increase their visibility in the city. from
    pedestrians to the sea, the graffiti walls will be visible on all urban levels. The concrete walls
    which will create semi-private rooms will be used for Graffiti painting. By activating the place
    this way, I believe I will attract a broader audience to the area. By dedicating such a central place
    in Stockholm to subcultures I believe can give the smaller groups a chance to integrate with the
    rest of the society and get their voices heard.`,

    text: `The slums of Napoli needs a new chance`,
    paragraph: `Le Vele Verde: A symbol of Italy’s failure of modern-day social housing (The Guardian).
    Le Vele Verde, four high rise blocks of concrete, interrelated through courtyards Each block
    formed as a pyramid shape to allow terraces of greenery for cultivation and socializing. Lofts and
    inner pathways as a means of circulation in between this concrete jungle to make sure people run
    into each other and socialize at all instants. Minimize time spent indoors to maximize time spent
    outdoors.
    Each concrete block turned into a zone of drug marketing. The pyramid-shaped blocks were
    perfect to shadow the police and alert the neighboring dealers to run if police were approaching.
    One zone would alert the other, by the time police approached the crime scene the dealers would
    have managed to escape and hide inside the inner pathways that once were designed to elevate
    the concept of social housing. The mafia had given jobs and opportunities to the inhabitants of
    Le Vele Verde, it had come to save those people that were less fortunate and make the
    neighborhood of Scampia well known and prosperous to the world.
    
    Le Vele Verde is to be demolished, and the inhabitants need another chance for survival. The
    Mafia has sure brought anguish and suffering, but it has undoubtedly provided jobs and a sense
    of belonging. This project aims to propose a new social housing that can learn and provide the
    way the mafia did, but in a greenway. I am proposing to create social housing where you can pay
    your rent with the money you earn from cultivating and selling your vegetables in your front
    yard. A meeting point of households and business. This proposal aims to create households with
    their own cultivating business.`,
